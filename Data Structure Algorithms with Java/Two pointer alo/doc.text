Here is **one very easy two-pointer array example**, explained **step by step using pointers `i` and `j`**, in simple language.

## Example Problem (Very Easy)

**Problem:**
Check whether a **sorted array** contains **two numbers whose sum is 10**.

**Array:**

```
A = [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize the Two Pointers

* `i` → starts at the **beginning**
* `j` → starts at the **end**

```
Index:  0  1  2  3  4
Array:  1  2  3  7  8
         i           j
```

---

## Step 2: Move the Pointers Step by Step

### 🔹 Step 1

* `A[i] + A[j] = 1 + 8 = 9`
* **9 < 10** → sum is too small
* Move `i` **one step forward**

```
Index:  0  1  2  3  4
Array:  1  2  3  7  8
            i        j
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2

* `A[i] + A[j] = 2 + 8 = 10`
* **10 == target** ✅
* Pair found!

---

## Final Answer

The two numbers are:

```
2 and 8
```

---

## Why `i` and `j` Move Like This (Easy Explanation)

* If the **sum is too small**, increase it → move `i` right
* If the **sum is too large**, decrease it → move `j` left
* Because the array is **sorted**, this always works correctly

---

## One-Line Definition (Very Simple)

> The two-pointer method uses `i` and `j` to scan an array from both ends and adjust them step by step to find the answer efficiently.
